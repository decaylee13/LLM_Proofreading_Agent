# LLM_Proofreading_Agent
LLM proofreading performance through NeuroGlancer

TODO: 
- Copy example.ipynb and all relevant dependencies to this repo
- Rework notebook to work with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, LLAMA, Claude APIs - one notebook for each model so people can download notebook + dependencies to see for themselves
- Develop a very good prompt to hopefully give LLMs good chance to perform well
- On leaderboard, make a separate (hidden) tab showing the images of the LLM performances along with the states and decided actions, as well as download to relevant python notebook
- Rework with Example.py (ngllib library) later on
